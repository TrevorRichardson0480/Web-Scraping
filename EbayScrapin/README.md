# Web-Scraping
Trying out web scraping for the first time. Coming back to Python. First scraper is simple and reads all the bids off of the ads on my eBay store (if and when I put things on there, it should theoretically work). Outputs the name of the ad and the number of bids to a csv. I would like to do a more complicated scraper as soon as I can think of what it should do.
